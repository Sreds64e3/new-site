## About Me

My name is Eugen Dolezai and I focus on questions of social ethics, especially in relation to technology ethics. My research focuses on artificial intelligence and neurotechnologies and their significance for people and society. Since the beginning of my academic career at the University of Graz, I have been dedicated to researching the relationship between humans and machines, with the aim of identifying dangers and risks in the context of technological development to promote the use of new technologies with people at the center.
